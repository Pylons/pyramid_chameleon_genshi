repoze.bfg.chameleon_genshi
===========================

0.3 (2010-07-09)
----------------

- By default, Chameleon's Genshi XIncludes support cannot resolve
  ``repoze.bfg`` "resource specifications"
  (e.g. ``my_package:foo/bar.genshi``).  In order to activate an
  XIncludes class that understands repoze.bfg resource specifications,
  call the ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_genshi.XIncludes.activate`` method
  before using any templates (e.g., at process startup time)::

    from repoze.bfg.chameleon_genshi import XIncludes
    XIncludes.activate()

  This will replace the XIncludes helper class for all consumers of
  Chameleon in the process.

- Depend on Chameleon >= 1.2.8 (replaceable XIncludes class).

0.2 (2010-06-15)
----------------

- Bring up to speed with BFG 1.3.X.

0.1 (2009-05-02)
----------------

- Initial release (break code out of BFG core).
